# Command reference
## General commands
### Configure CLI connection to NGB server
```
ngb set_srv|srv [<NGB_API_URL>] [options]

//Options:
//-t (--table)          Print result as a human-readable table
//-j (--json)           Print result as a JSON string
```
*Description*

Sets NGB server API URL. By default CLI uses **localhost** to call API. If one need to use CLI on a remote machine - appropriate URL should be set.

URL should be specified using the following format: **http://{NGB_SERVER_NAME_OR_IP}:{NGB_SERVER_PORT}/catgenome**

When URL is set - it would be stored and used next time CLI is launched

*Example*
```
//Sets remote server for CLI
ngb set_srv http://10.248.33.51:8080/catgenome
```

## Display CLI version

```
ngb version|v
```
*Description*

Prints CLI version to the console standard output.

## Search an object on a server
```
ngb search|s [<QUERY>] [options]

//Options:
//-l (--like)           If specified - search will be done using a substring. Be default strong equality comparison will be used
//-t (--table)          Print result as a human-readable table
//-j (--json)           Print result as a JSON string
```
*Description*

Searches for a specified string in reference and file names. By default, command will search for exactly equal name,  if -l option is specified - a search query will used as a substring.

*Example*
```
//Search for all objects, that contain "vcf" substring in their names and ouput result as a human-readable table
ngb search -l vcf -t

//Search file, named exactly "sample_1.bam" and ouput result as a json string
ngb search sample_1.bam
```

## Reference commands
### Register reference sequence
```
ngb reg_ref|rr [<PATH_TO_GENOME_FASTA>] [options]

//Options:
//-n (--name) [value]       Use specified value for reference sequence name. If not specified - fasta file name will be used. Should be unique
//-t (--table)              Print result as a human-readable table
//-j (--json)               Print result as a JSON string
//-g (--genes) [value]      Add a gene (gtf or gff) file to the reference. If file is already registered, it can be addressed by name or an identifier. Otherwise a path to the file should be provided.
//-ngc (--nogccontent)      Disables calculation of GC-content for large scale reference view
//-pt (--pretty)            Add pretty name to the reference genome
```
*Description*

Registers a specified reference sequence file. FASTA, FA, FNA files are accepted. GZip-compressed files are not supported.
Path to local file and remote URL are accepted as a path to the reference. For local files, NGB will try to find a matching "fai" index 
in the folder with the reference, if index isn't found it will be created. For remote references, "fai" index must be present on the
remote source. NGB assumes that reference index will have the same name as reference with "fai" extension added. If reference path is
**"/opt/genomes/hg38.fa"**, NGB will look for index file at path **"/opt/genomes/hg38.fa.fai"**.

*Example*
```
//Register reference, use "grch.38.fa" as name
ngb reg_ref /opt/genomes/grch.38.fa

//Register reference, use "grch38" as name
ngb rr /opt/genomes/grch.38.fa -n grch38
```
### List reference sequences
```
ngb list_ref|lr [options]

//Options:
//-t (--table)          Print result as a human-readable table
//-j (--json)           Print result as a JSON string
```
*Description*

Lists all reference sequences registered on the NGB server. The command output format is specified by
-t and -j options, default format is Json.

*Example*
```
//List all reference files from the server
ngb list_ref -t
```

### Delete reference sequence
```
ngb del_ref|dr [<REFERENCE_NAME|REFERENCE_ID>] [options]

```
*Description*

Registers a specified file. At least two arguments have to be specified:
Previously registered reference sequence file from NGB server. Reference file can be addressed by name or an identifier
Flesystem path to the file to be registered. BAM, VCF, GFF, GTF, BED, SEG, WIG, BED GRAPH files are accepted. GZipped files are also accepted in a format <FILE_NAME>.<FILE_EXT>.gz, e.g.: my_variants.vcf.gz.
BAM file path has to be followed by a '?' symbol and a path to an index file (.BAI) 
(If a folder with BAM file also contains index for this BAM with the same name, CLI will find this index automatically. 
It also works well for vcf, bed and gene files). 
If and only if cli located on the same filesystem with NGB server relative path can be used.

*Example*
```
//Register file, use "sample.vcf" as name for reference with id 18
ngb reg_file 18 /opt/tracks/sample.vcf

//Register file, use "sample" as name for reference with name grch38
ngb reg_file grch38 /opt/tracks/sample.vcf -n sample

//Register indexed file, use "sample.bam" as name
ngb reg_file grch38 /opt/tracks/sample.bam?/opt/tracks/sample.bam.bai

//Register indexed file, use "sample.bam" as name, index for the BAM file is contained in the same directory as the BAM file
ngb reg_file grch38 /opt/tracks/sample.bam

//Register file with relative path
ngb reg_file hg19 ../tracks/sample.vcf
```

### Delete file
```
ngb del_file|df [<FILE_NAME>|<FILE_ID>] [options]

//Options:
//-t (--table)          Print result as a human-readable table
//-j (--json)           Print result as a JSON string
```
*Description*

```
*Description*

Command builds a feature index for a specified file.
This can be useful to reindex a file or to create one if a file was registered with `--no_index` option.
Feature index is used for search and filtering capabilities for BED/VCF/GFF/GTF files.
File could be address by name or an identifier.

*Note: this command is used for internal NGB indexing - it could not be used to index BAM/CRAM files*

*Example*
```
//Build index for "sample.vcf" file 
ngb index_file sample.vcf

//Build index for a file with identifier "18"
ngb if 18
```

```

### Move dataset (change dataset's hierarchy)
```
ngb move_dataset|md [<DATASET_NAME>|<DATASET_ID>] [options]

//Options:
//-p (--parent)         Change the dataset's parent to this value 
```
*Description*

Changes the dataset's hierarchy. Without options the command will move the specified dataset
to the top level od datasets' hierarchy (dataset's parent will be removed). If option -p (--parent)
is specified the dataset's parent will be changed to this option value.

*Example*
```
//Make dataset with ID 21 a top level dataset without a parent
ngb move_dataset 21

//Make dataset with name "data_parent" the parent dataset for a dataset with name "data_1" 
ngb md data_1 -p data_parent

datasets without nested datasets. Dataset's hierarchy may be loaded with an option 'parent': if 
a parent dataset is set, the command will output the parent itself and all nested datasets. Parent
dataset may be addressed by name or ID.

*Example*
```
//List all top-level datasets from the server
ngb list_dataset

//List hierarchy tree for a dataset with the name "data_1"
ngb ld -p data_1
```

//-f (--force)          Allow to delete project with nested projects
```
*Description*

Deletes a specified dataset from NGB server. Dataset could be addressed by name or by an identifier (retrieved from **reg_dataset** command, at registration time, or **search** command)

Files that were added to a dataset are not deleted by this command, as soon they might be used (now or later) in other datasets.

*Example*
```
//Delete dataset, named "new_dataset"
ngb del_dataset new_dataset

//Delete dataset with id "1"
ngb dd 1
```


### Generate URL for browsing selected files
```
ngb url [<DATASET_NAME>|<DATASET_ID>] [<FILE_IDS>|<FILE_NAMES>] [options]

*Example*
```

//Create URL for dataset with name 'data' and files with IDs 42, 45 and a file with name 'sample.vcf'
ngb url data 42 45 sample.vcf

//Create URL for dataset with ID '5' and a file with name 'sample.vcf' on a chromosome 1 on positions from 13476 to 23476
ngb url 5 sample.vcf -loc 1:13476-23476

//Create URL for dataset with name 'data' and a file with name 'sample.vcf' on a chromosome 1
ngb url data sample.vcf -loc 1
```


## Utility commands
### Sort feature file
```
ngb sort [<ORIGINAL_FILE_PATH>] [<SORTED_FILE_PATH>] [options]

//Options:
//-m (--max_memory) [value] Specifies amount of memory in megabytes to use for sorting (default: 500). Since memory usage estimation is approximate, real memory usage may vary to some extend.
```
*Description*

Sorts given feature file. At least one argument should be specified:
* Path to a feature file to be sorted.
VCF, BED, GTF, GFF, GFF3 formats are supported. Uncompressed and BGZip-compressed files are supported.

Optional argument is:
* Target path to store a sorted feature file.
If this argument is not specified, sorted file will be stored in the same folder as the original one with the `.sorted.` suffix in the name.
Sorted file will be automatically BGZip-compressed, if a target file name contains `.gz` postfix. If target file is not specified, file compression is inherited from the original file.

*Example*
```
//Will sort given VCF file and place it in the same folder with original file ('/samples/sample.vcf.gz') with name: sample.sorted.vcf.gz
ngb sort /samples/sample.vcf.gz

//Will sort given GFF file and place sorted file to the specified path '/samples/sample-sorted.gff'
ngb sort /samples/sample.gff /samples/sample-sorted.gff

//Will sort given BED file, compress result and place sorted file to the specified path '/samples/sorted_sample.bed.gz'
ngb sort /samples/unsorted.bed /samples/sorted_sample.bed.gz
