# Command reference
## General commands
### Configure CLI connection to NGB server
#### Set NGB server URL
```
ngb set_srv|srv [<NGB_API_URL>] [options]

//Options:
//-t (--table)          Print result as a human-readable table
//-j (--json)           Print result as a JSON string
```
*Description*

Sets NGB server API URL. By default CLI uses **localhost** to call API. If one need to use CLI on a remote machine - appropriate URL should be set.

URL should be specified using the following format: **http://{NGB_SERVER_NAME_OR_IP}:{NGB_SERVER_PORT}/catgenome**

When URL is set - it would be stored and used next time CLI is launched.

*Example*
```bash
# Sets remote server for CLI
$ ngb set_srv http://10.248.33.51:8080/catgenome
```
#### Set authorization token
```
ngb set_token|st [<JWT_TOKEN>]
```
*Description*

Sets JWT token to authorize CLI requests to NGB server API. Required if authorization is enabled on NGB.

*Example*
```bash
# Sets remote server for CLI
$ ngb set_token eyJhbGciOiJSUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ0ZXN0X3VzZXIiLCJ1c2VyX
```

## Display CLI version

```
ngb version|v
```
*Description*

Prints CLI version to the console standard output.

## Search an object on a server
```
ngb search|s [<QUERY>] [options]

//Options:
//-l (--like)               If specified - search will be done using a substring. Be default strong equality comparison will be used
//-t (--table)              Print result as a human-readable table
//-j (--json)               Print result as a JSON string
//-perm (--permissions)     Print permissions on each found object (if they are set)
```
*Description*

Searches for a specified string in reference and file names. By default, command will search for exactly equal name,  if `-l` option is specified - a search query will used as a substring. If `-perm` option is specified - permissions on each found file for user(s)/group(s)/role(s) will be printed (if they are set).

*Example*
```bash
# Search for all objects, that contain "vcf" substring in their names and
# ouput result as a human-readable table
$ ngb search -l vcf -t

# Search file, named exactly "sample_1.bam" and ouput result as a json string
$ ngb search sample_1.bam

# Search for all objects, that contain "gene" substring in their names and
# output permissions on them:
$ ngb search -l gene -perm
```

## Reference commands
### Register reference sequence
```
ngb reg_ref|rr [<PATH_TO_GENOME_FASTA>] [options]

//Options:

//-t (--table)              Print result as a human-readable table
//-j (--json)               Print result as a JSON string
//-g (--genes) [value]      Add a gene (gtf or gff) file to the reference. If file is already registered, it can be addressed by name or an identifier. Otherwise a path to the file should be provided.
//-ngc (--nogccontent)      Disables calculation of GC-content for large scale reference view
//-pt (--pretty)            Add pretty name to the reference genome
//-s (--species)            Add species version to registering reference. Note: species should be already registered on NGB server.
```
*Description*

Registers a specified reference sequence file. FASTA, FA, FNA, GENBANK, GBK, GB files are accepted. Compressed files are not supported.
Path to local file and remote URL are accepted as a path to the reference. For local files, NGB will try to find a matching "fai" index 
in the folder with the reference, if index isn't found it will be created. For remote references, "fai" index must be present on the
remote source. NGB assumes that reference index will have the same name as reference with "fai" extension added. If reference path is
**"/opt/genomes/hg38.fa"**, NGB will look for index file at path **"/opt/genomes/hg38.fa.fai"**.

*Example*
```bash
# Register reference, use "grch.38.fa" as name
$ ngb reg_ref /opt/genomes/grch.38.fa

# Register reference, use "grch38" as name
$ ngb rr /opt/genomes/grch.38.fa -n grch38
```

```
*Description*

Registers a specified file. At least two arguments have to be specified:
- Previously registered reference sequence file from NGB server. Reference file can be addressed by name or an identifier.
- Filesystem path to the file to be registered. BAM, VCF, GFF, GTF, BED, SEG, WIG, BED GRAPH files are accepted. BGZipped files are also accepted in a format <FILE_NAME>.<FILE_EXT>.gz, e.g.: my_variants.vcf.gz. (**bgzip** tool is available as a part of [htslib](http://www.htslib.org/) package. Or NGB CLI **sort** command can used for that as well).
BAM file path must be followed by a `?` symbol and a path to an index file (.BAI) (if a folder with BAM file also contains index for this BAM with the same name, CLI will find this index automatically. It also works well for vcf, bed and gene files). 
If and only if CLI located on the same filesystem with NGB server relative path can be used.

To register files from the external cloud data storages (AWS S3), file path must be in the full view (starting from `s3://`, then the bucket name, folder name and so on slash-separated, ending with <FILE_NAME>.<FILE_EXT>), e.g.: `s3://ngb-s3/fruitfly/agnX1.09-28.trim.dm606.realign.vcf`. In case with AWS S3 storages, path to the files with indexes (BAM, VCF, BED, genes files) must be strongly followed by a `?` symbol and a path to their index files. CLI will not find such indexes automatically.
> **Note**: for ability to work with files from AWS S3, do not forget to configure your NGB instance before start (see *"Configure for working with AWS S3"* paragraph [here](../installation/standalone.md)).


*Example*
```bash
# Register file, use "sample.vcf" as a name for reference with id 18
$ ngb reg_file 18 /opt/tracks/sample.vcf

# Register file, use "sample" as a name for reference with the name grch38
$ ngb reg_file grch38 /opt/tracks/sample.vcf -n sample

# Register indexed file, use "sample.bam" as a name
$ ngb reg_file grch38 /opt/tracks/sample.bam?/opt/tracks/sample.bam.bai

# Register indexed file, use "sample.bam" as a name, index for the BAM file is contained in the same directory as the BAM file
$ ngb reg_file grch38 /opt/tracks/sample.bam

# Register file with relative path
$ ngb reg_file hg19 ../tracks/sample.vcf

# Register file from AWS S3, use "sample1" as a name
$ ngb reg_file grch38 s3://ngb-s3/human/grch38_tracks/sample1.vcf -n sample1

# Register indexed file from AWS S3, use "sample1.bam" as a name
$ ngb reg_file grch38 s3://ngb-s3/human/grch38_tracks/sample1.bam?s3://ngb-s3/human/grch38_tracks/sample1.bam.bai --name sample1.bam
```

### Delete file
```
ngb del_file|df [<FILE_NAME>|<FILE_ID>] [options]

//Options:
//-t (--table)          Print result as a human-readable table
//-j (--json)           Print result as a JSON string
```
*Description*

Deletes a specified file from NGB server. File can be addressed by name or an identifier (retrieved from **reg_file** command, at registration time or **search** command).
> **Note**: file couldn't be deleted, if it is added to any dataset. For deleting such file first remove it from all datasets. 

*Example*
```bash
# Delete file with name "my_sample"
$ ngb del_file my_sample

# Delete file with id 18
$ ngb df 18
```

### Build feature index for a file
```
ngb index_file|if [<PATH_TO_NGS_FILE>] [options]

//Options:
//-t (--table)              Print result as a human-readable table
//-j (--json)               Print result as a JSON string
```
*Description*

Command builds a feature index for a specified file.
This can be useful to reindex a file or to create one if a file was registered with `--no_index` option.
Feature index is used for search and filtering capabilities for BED/VCF/GFF/GTF files.
File could be address by name or an identifier.

> **Note**: this command is used for internal NGB indexing - it could not be used to index BAM/CRAM files

*Example*
```bash
# Build index for "sample.vcf" file 
$ ngb index_file sample.vcf

# Build index for a file with identifier "18"
$ ngb if 18
```

## Utility commands
### Sort feature file
```
ngb sort [<ORIGINAL_FILE_PATH>] [<SORTED_FILE_PATH>] [options]

//Options:
//-m (--max_memory) [value] Specifies amount of memory in megabytes to use for sorting (default: 500). Since memory usage estimation is approximate, real memory usage may vary to some extend.
```
*Description*

Sorts given feature file. At least one argument should be specified:
* Path to a feature file to be sorted.
VCF, BED, GTF, GFF, GFF3 formats are supported. Uncompressed and BGZip-compressed files are supported.

Optional argument is:
* Target path to store a sorted feature file.
If this argument is not specified, sorted file will be stored in the same folder as the original one with the `.sorted.` suffix in the name.
Sorted file will be automatically BGZip-compressed, if a target file name contains `.gz` postfix. If target file is not specified, file compression is inherited from the original file.

*Example*
```bash
# Will sort given VCF file and place it in the same folder
# with original file ('/samples/sample.vcf.gz') with name: sample.sorted.vcf.gz
$ ngb sort /samples/sample.vcf.gz

# Will sort given GFF file and place sorted file to the specified path
# '/samples/sample-sorted.gff'
$ ngb sort /samples/sample.gff /samples/sample-sorted.gff

# Will sort given BED file, compress result and place sorted file
# to the specified path '/samples/sorted_sample.bed.gz'
$ ngb sort /samples/unsorted.bed /samples/sorted_sample.bed.gz
```

## Security commands
### Create user
```
ngb reg_user|ru <USER_NAME> [options]

//Options:
//-gr (--groups) <GROUP_ID>|<GROUP_NAME>[,<GROUP_ID>|<GROUP_NAME>...]    Add newly created user to the groups and assign roles, specified in this option. A comma-separated list can be specified
//-t (--table)                                                          Print result as a human-readable table
//-j (--json)                                                           Print result as a JSON string
```
*Description*

Registers a user with the specified <USER_NAME> in the NGB. Optionally, a comma-separated list of groups/roles can be specified using `-gr` option.
> For the correct command's behavior use list from only group/role ids or only names at once. Don't mix them.

Disregarding whether `-gr` is specified - default *ROLE_USER* will be always set.

*Example*
```bash
# Register user with a default `ROLE_USER` role assigned
$ ngb reg_user test_user@example.com

# Register user and assign to additional groups: "Developers" and "QA"
$ ngb reg_user test_user@example.com -gr Developers,QA
```

### Delete user
```
ngb del_user|du <USER_ID>|<USER_NAME> [options]

//Options:
//-t (--table)          Print result as a human-readable table
//-j (--json)           Print result as a JSON string
```
*Description*

Deletes a user, specified by a <USER_ID> or <USER_NAME> parameter. This will result in 401 "Access denied" for all subsequent requests from the deleted user.

*Example*
```bash
# Delete user 'test_user@example.com' from the NGB server
$ ngb del_user test_user@example.com
```

### Create user group
```
ngb reg_group|rgrp <GROUP_NAME> [options]

//Options:
//-u (--users) <USER_ID>|<USER_NAME>[,<USER_ID>|<USER_NAME>...]     Once a group is created, specified user(s) will be added to that group as members. A comma-separated list of user ids/names can be specified
//-t (--table)                                                      Print result as a human-readable table
//-j (--json)                                                       Print result as a JSON string
```

*Description*

Creates a new user group named, as specified by <GROUP_NAME> parameter. If `-u` option is specified - a list of user(s) will be added into the new group as members.
> For the correct command's behavior use list from only user ids or only names at once. Don't mix them.

*Example*
```bash
# Create a new empty group (users shall be added to the group further)
ngb reg_group Developers

# Create a new group with two members 'test_user@example.com', 'test_user2@example.com'
ngb reg_group Developers -u test_user@example.com,test_user2@example.com
```

### Delete user group
```

//-j (--json)           Print result as a JSON string
```

*Description*

Deletes user group, specified by a <GROUP_ID>|<GROUP_NAME> parameter, from the NGB server. Members of the group won't be deleted, they will be just unassigned from the deleted group.

*Example*
```bash
# Delete a user group named 'Developers'
$ ngb del_group Developers
```

### Add user to an existing group
```
ngb add_group|agrp <GROUP_ID>|<GROUP_NAME> -u|--users <USER_ID>|<USER_NAME>[,<USER_ID>|<USER_NAME>...] [options]

//Options:
//-t (--table)          Print result as a human-readable table
//-j (--json)           Print result as a JSON string
```

*Description*

Adds a single user or a list of users to the group, specified by <GROUP_ID> or <GROUP_NAME> parameter. A comma-separated list of user ids or names can be specified.
> For the correct command's behavior use list from only user ids or only names at once. Don't mix them.

*Example*

```bash
# Add 'test_user@example.com' and 'test_user2@example.com' users as members of the 'Developers' group
$ ngb add_group Developers test_user@example.com,test_user2@example.com
```

### Set permissions on the object
```
ngb chmod {mod} [options]

//Arguments:
//{mod} - mandatory parameter, that contains two parts: [Permission][Action type]
//Permission:
//r - read permission
//w - write permission
//rw - both, read and write permissions
//Action type:
//`+` - to grant permission
//`-` - to deny permission
//`!` - to remove all already assigned permissions

//Options:
//-ds|--datasets <DATASET_NAME>[,<DATASET_NAME>...]
//-fl|--files <FILE_NAME>[,<FILE_NAME>...]
//-u|--users <USER_NAME>[,<USER_NAME>...]
//-gr|--groups <GROUP_NAME>[,<GROUP_NAME>...]
```
*Description*

Grants or denies permissions on the objects (files and datasets) for specific user(s), group(s), role(s). Comma-separated lists of file/dataset/user/group/role names can be specified.
> Note:
> - One of or both --datasets/--files shall be specified
> - One of or both --users/--groups shall be specified
> - Operation is NOT recursive, applied only to the specified --datasets/--files

*Example*
```bash
# Grant 'read' permission on the file 'gene_file' for the user 'test_user@example.com' and 'Developers' group:
$ ngb chmod r+ -fl gene_file -u test_user@example.com -gr Developers

# Remove assigned permissions on the dataset 'fruitfly_local' for the user 'test_user@example.com':
$ ngb chmod ! -ds fruitfly_local -u test_user@example.com

# Deny 'read' and 'write' permissions on the file 'gene_file' and dataset 'fruitfly_local' for the 'Developers' group:
$ ngb chmod rw- -fl gene_file -ds fruitfly_local -gr Developers
```
