# Permissions management

> **_Note_**: permissions management is available only for the users with the *ADMIN* role.

The permissions on the object could be granted to the user in one of the following ways:

- the system has a "default" system role or users' group. This type of the system roles/groups assigned by default once a new user is created;
- assigned user groups or system roles where each member has the same permissions for specific objects;
- granted permissions for the specific user.

To open the form for changing permissions on the specific object (file or dataset) click right mouse-button on its name when hover over it in **Datasets list**, e.g.:  
    ![NGB User Management](images/um-permissions-1.png)

Tap "MANAGE PERMISSIONS" in the context menu:  
    ![NGB User Management](images/um-permissions-2.png)

The pop-up window will be appeared:  
    ![NGB User Management](images/um-permissions-3.png)

In this window you can change an owner of the object, grant or deny permissions on the object to the users, groups and roles.

## Change an owner

Each object has an additional "Owner" property. Owner property is assigned to the user that created an object.

To change an owner of the object click on owner's name and select from the dropdown list another user (**1**), confirm choice by clicking on ![NGB User Management](images/um-permissions-4.png) icon opposite the inputted user name (**2**):

    Set values will be saved automatically.

    > You could do the same through CLI using the command:  
    > `$ ngb chmod rw+ -fl agnX1.09-28.trim.dm606.realign.vcf -u test_test@epam.com`  
    > Set that permissions for a specific dataset (e.g. for the dataset "*fruitfly_local*"):  
    > `$ ngb chmod rw+ -ds fruitfly_local -u test_test@epam.com`

5. You can unset permissions for the user by unticking checkboxes. Permissions settings will be displayed like:  
    ![NGB User Management](images/um-permissions-14.png)

    > You could do the same through CLI using the command:  
    > `$ ngb chmod ! -fl agnX1.09-28.trim.dm606.realign.vcf -u test_test@epam.com`  
    > Unset permissions for a specific dataset (e.g. for the dataset "*fruitfly_local*"):  
    > `$ ngb chmod ! -ds fruitfly_local -u test_test@epam.com`
