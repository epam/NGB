# BED track

- [Track colors](#track-colors)

BED tracks operate like the GENE track, showing a histogram at a low zoom level and separate features at higher zoom levels.

All fields specified for the BED format are supported (including description).

When you hover over a BED feature, a tooltip with the feature's details appears.

7. If you wish to apply changed color scheme for all `BED` tracks in the browser - return at step 3 and set the "**Apply to all BED tracks**" checkbox.  

Also, you can manage the colors for a group of selected `BED` tracks. For that, use the **General** -> **Color** items in the [floating menu](tracks.md#tracks-selection) of selected tracks:

In such case, the set color scheme will be applied to all selected `BED` tracks:
