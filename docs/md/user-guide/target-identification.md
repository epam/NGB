Via the **Target Identification** panel users can collect identification information about targets of interest (genes), store this information and use it for their own research purposes.

**Target identification** panel can be opened via the **VIEWS** menu and includes sub-tabs:

- **Targets** (_opened by default_) - sub-panel where user can manage targets
- **Identifications** - sub-panel where user can view and manage target identification reports

## Manage targets

**Targets** management sub-tab contains the following objects:

- Table of previously created (added) targets. For each target in that table, there are columns:
    - **Name** - target name. Name is displayed as a hyperlink. By click it, the target details form will be opened
    - **Genes** - genes/transcripts that are included in this target
    - **Species** - species that are included in this target
    - **Diseases** - diseases that are associated with the target
    - **Products** - products that are associated with the target
    - **Owner** - name of the user who created the target
    - Column that contains buttons to launch identification process for the selected target
- Button to add a new target

**_Note_**: if there are more than 2 items in any column of the targets table, additional items will be hidden and only their summary number is shown. Click that number to view details, e.g.:  
  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-02.png)  
  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-03.png)

To sort the **Targets** table by the **Name** column - click the corresponding header. To invert the sorting order, click the header again, e.g.:  
  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-04.png)

**Targets** table supports filtering. To filter displayed targets - use one or more parameters to filter items in the table.  
To enable filters - use the menu ![NGB GUI](images/targets-05.png) in the right upper corner of the panel. The approach is fully the same as described for the [Variants panel](variants.md#filters-for-variants-panel):  
  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-06.png)

  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-07.png)

  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-08.png)

To clear all filters - use the menu ![NGB GUI](images/targets-09.png) in the right upper corner of the panel.

### Target creation

To create a new target, there are following ways:

- Via GUI:
    - Add a new target manually from the **Targets** sub-tab
    - Create a target from any found orthogroup (using the **Homologs** panel)
- Via CLI

#### Creation from "Targets" sub-panel

To create a new target:

1. Click the "**Create target**" button at the **Targets** sub-panel:  
  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-10.png)
2. The following form will appear:  
  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-11.png)  
  This form contains:  
    - button to return to the targets table form
    - field to specify the name of the creating target
    - button to add a gene/transcript to the target
    - button to add an associated disease to the target
    - button to add an associated product to the target
    - button to save the creating target
3. Specify the new target name.
4. Click the button "**Add gene**" to add a gene/transcript to the target.  
    A new row with empty fields will appear - for the specifying info for a gene - **Gene ID**, **Gene Name**, **Tax ID** (taxonomy ID of species), **Species Name** and **Priority** (priority of the adding gene in the current target's genes list):  
    ![NGB GUI](images/targets-12.png)
5. Specify all fields for a gene/transcript (**Priority** field is non-required, others - mandatory).  
  There are abilities for specifying genes:  
    - fully manual way when you shall specify the value in each field as a plain text
    - "autofilling" with automatically suggested values of genes using appearing ones during the input **Gene ID**/**Gene Name** - these values are being suggested from the existing genes database, e.g.:  
      ![NGB GUI](images/targets-13.png)  
      When the gene/gene ID is selected from the suggested list - all other fields (except **Priority**) will be autofilled in:  
      ![NGB GUI](images/targets-14.png)
    - mix of the manual and "autofilling" ways
6. **Priority** can be left empty or manually selected from the list:  
  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-15.png)
7. By the described way (steps 4-6), add desired number of genes/transcripts. Near each gene/transcript, there is a button to remove gene from the list, e.g.:  
  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-16.png)
8. Add disease(s) associated with the target (_optionally_).  
  To add a disease, click the corresponding field and specify the disease manually. After the input, press _Enter_ key, e.g.:  
  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-17.png)  
  You may add any count of associated diseases by the described way. To remove a disease from the list - use the cross button near the disease name.
9. Add product(s) associated with the target (_optionally_).  
  To add a product, click the corresponding field and specify the product manually. After the input, press _Enter_ key, e.g.:  
  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-18.png)  
  You may add any count of associated products by the described way. To remove a product from the list - use the cross button near the product name.
10. Once all desired values are added - click the **Create** button.  
  Target will be saved, the **Remove** button will appear, the **Save** button will become disabled:  
  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-19.png)  
  Click the button ![NGB GUI](images/targets-20.png) to return to the **Targets** table. Just created target will appear in the list:

2. Right-click any orthogroup from the search results list to view the context menu, e.g.:  
  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-22.png)  
  Select the item "_Create target_" from the context menu.
3. The pre-filled form of the target creation will appear:  
  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-23.png)  
  Here, list of all genes from the selected orthogroup will be autofilled in.
4. Specify the name for the creating target.
5. Specify another missing info, if necessary.
6. Otherwise, the procedure is the same as in the section [above](#creation-from-targets-sub-panel).

### Edit/remove target

To edit previously created target:

1. Click the target row/name in the **Targets** table, e.g.:  
  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-24.png)  
2. The form similar to the target's creation form will be opened:  
  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-25.png)  

Here, you can edit the target (edit target name, add/edit/remove genes from the list, add/remove diseases and products) and then save changes or remove the target - by the corresponding buttons.

## Launch identification

To launch a new identifying process:

1. Find the target in the **Targets** table and click the button to launch identification process, e.g.:

Table supports sorting by any column. Click the column header to sort by this column. To invert the sorting order, click the header again.

**Bubbles view**

This view provides a hierarchical representation of the associated diseases using encapsulated bubbles:

- Each associated disease is presented as a bubble colored by its overall association score.
- Big circles represent all the therapeutic areas (from the **Open Targets** platform). Such circles contain associated diseases bubbles inside.
- As the same disease can belong to more than one therapeutic area, diseases bubbles can be duplicated.  
- There is the ability to select a gene from target genes for which the representation of the associated diseases will be displayed.

![NGB GUI](images/targets-42.png)

There is the ability to adjust the view of bubbles using a minimum score filter in the upper side of the view (slider control).  
By setting this score, only bubbles with overall score above it will be displayed at the diagram, e.g.:  
  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-43.png)

Hovering over any disease bubble, a tooltip appears with details:

- associated disease name and ID

When the block is collapsed - its header contains short info about the summary count of all publications mentioned the target gene(s):  
  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-49.png)

When the block is expanded - it contains list of references to publications mentioned the target gene(s).  
Each reference contains:

- publication title - as the hyperlink to the corresponding publication on **PubMed**
- list of publication authors
- publication source title and date

![NGB GUI](images/targets-50.png)

There is the ability to generate a summary of the found bibliography using AI capabilities.

> **_Note_**: this summary is generated using pretrained AI language model and its text generation functionality.  
> For the summary, only abstracts of the several "top" (most relevant) publications are used.  
> As the summary is generated by AI and this process is poorly controlled, the summary block can vary for each request for the same list of publications.

To generate a summary of the found bibliography - click the corresponding button in the upper side of the block:  
  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-51.png)

It takes some time to generate the summary. Once the summary is prepared - it will appear in the upper side of the block:  
  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-52.png)

You can (re)generate the summary in the described way as many times as you need.  

> **_Note_**: you can change the AI model that will be used for the Bibliography summary generation - select the model from the dropdown list of AI settings - see details in the section [below](#ai-model-settings).  
> Once the model is changed - the summary will be regenerated with that AI model, e.g.:  
>   ![NGB GUI](images/targets-55.png)

### Chat with AI
