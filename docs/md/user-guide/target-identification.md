Via the **Target Identification** panel users can collect identification information about targets of interest (genes), store this information and use it for their own research purposes.

**Target identification** panel can be opened via the **VIEWS** menu and includes sub-tabs:

- [**Targets**](#manage-targets) (_opened by default_) - sub-panel where user can manage targets
- [**Identifications**](#identification-results) - sub-panel where user can view and manage target identification reports
- [**Diseases**](#diseases-search) - sub-panel where user can search for drugs and targets associated with a specific disease

## Manage targets

**Targets** management sub-tab contains the following objects:

- Table of previously created (added) targets. For each target in that table, there are columns:
    - **Name** - target name. Name is displayed as a hyperlink. By click it, the target details form will be opened
    - **Genes** - genes/transcripts that are included in this target
    - **Species** - species that are included in this target
    - **Diseases** - diseases that are associated with the target
    - **Products** - products that are associated with the target
    - **Owner** - name of the user who created the target
    - Column that contains buttons to launch identification process for the selected target
- Button to add a new target

**_Note_**: if there are more than 2 items in any column of the targets table, additional items will be hidden and only their summary number is shown. Click that number to view details, e.g.:  
  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-02.png)  
  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-03.png)

To sort the **Targets** table by the **Name** column - click the corresponding header. To invert the sorting order, click the header again, e.g.:  
  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-04.png)

**Targets** table supports filtering. To filter displayed targets - use one or more parameters to filter items in the table.  
To enable filters - use the menu ![NGB GUI](images/targets-05.png) in the right upper corner of the panel. The approach is fully the same as described for the [Variants panel](variants.md#filters-for-variants-panel):  
  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-06.png)

  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-07.png)

  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-08.png)

To clear all filters - use the menu ![NGB GUI](images/targets-09.png) in the right upper corner of the panel.

### Target creation

To create a new target, there are following ways:

- Via GUI:
    - Add a new target manually [from the **Targets** sub-tab](#creation-from-targets-sub-panel)
    - Create a target [from any found orthogroup](#creation-from-homologs-panel) (using the **Homologs** panel)
- Via CLI

#### Creation from "Targets" sub-panel

To create a new target:

1. Click the "**Create target**" button at the **Targets** sub-panel:  
  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-10.png)
2. The following form will appear:

    - button to add an associated disease to the target
    - button to add an associated product to the target
    - button to launch identification - **Identify**
    - button to save the creating target - **Create**
3. Specify the new target name.
4. Click the button "**Add gene**" to add a gene/transcript to the target.  
    A new row with empty fields will appear - for the specifying info for a gene - **Gene ID**, **Gene Name**, **Tax ID** (taxonomy ID of species), **Species Name** and **Priority** (priority of the adding gene in the current target's genes list):  
    ![NGB GUI](images/targets-12.png)
5. Specify all fields for a gene/transcript (**Priority** field is non-required, others - mandatory).  
  There are abilities for specifying genes:  
    - fully manual way when you shall specify the value in each field as a plain text
    - "autofilling" with automatically suggested values of genes using appearing ones during the input **Gene ID**/**Gene Name** - these values are being suggested from the existing genes database, e.g.:  
      ![NGB GUI](images/targets-13.png)  
      When the gene/gene ID is selected from the suggested list - all other fields (except **Priority**) will be autofilled in:  
      ![NGB GUI](images/targets-14.png)
    - mix of the manual and "autofilling" ways
6. **Priority** can be left empty or manually selected from the list:  
  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-15.png)
7. By the described way (steps 4-6), add desired number of genes/transcripts. Near each gene/transcript, there is a button to remove gene from the list, e.g.:  
  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-16.png)
8. Add disease(s) associated with the target (_optionally_).  
  To add a disease, click the corresponding field and specify the disease manually. After the input, press _Enter_ key, e.g.:  
  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-17.png)  
  You may add any count of associated diseases by the described way. To remove a disease from the list - use the cross button near the disease name.
9. Add product(s) associated with the target (_optionally_).  
  To add a product, click the corresponding field and specify the product manually. After the input, press _Enter_ key, e.g.:  
  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-18.png)  
  You may add any count of associated products by the described way. To remove a product from the list - use the cross button near the product name.
10. Once all desired values are added - click the **Create** button. Target will be saved:  
    - The **Identify** button will become enabled
    - The **Create** button will disappear, instead the disabled **Save** button will appear
    - The **Remove** button will appear - to delete the target  
    ![NGB GUI](images/targets-19.png)

Table supports filtering. To filter displayed drugs - specify the desired value(s) to the filter field(s) under headers row.

To export table content in CSV format - click the corresponding [**Export**](#export-section) button above the table. Export to the local workstation will be started automatically.

### Associated targets

This section contains info about targets associated with the current disease.

When the section is collapsed - its header contains short info about the total count of associated target records:  
  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-91.png)

When the section is expanded - it contains:

- table for targets associated with the current disease
- button to export the table content to the local workstation in CSV format

![NGB GUI](images/targets-78.png)

Information for this section is obtained from [**Open Targets**](https://platform.opentargets.org/) platform.  
Table includes columns:

- _Target_ - symbol of the associated target
- _Target name_ - name of the associated target
- _Homologues_ - list of homologues associated with the target

#### "Ad hoc" target identification

For some cases, it is helpful to launch identification for a target without its registration.
It can be performed from the **Associated targets** section of the **Diseases** panel:

Find the desired target gene in the associated targets list and click its symbol, e.g.:  
  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-114.png)  
In the appeared menu, click the **Launch identification** item.

The new identifying process will be performed and, once finished, the **Identifications** sub-tab will be automatically opened with the results (identification report) for the selected target gene:  
  ![NGB GUI](images/targets-115.png)

Such report is similar to the one described above - in the [Identification results](#identification-results) section.  
The only differences are the following:

- the identification is being performed only for the selected _gene of interest_, therefore there are no _translational genes_
- as it is identification without gene registration - there is no ability to store the report, but you may export results if it is necessary
