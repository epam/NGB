# User management
The security policy in NGB is based on next principal entities: **Users**, **Groups**, **Roles** and **Permissions**.

## Users
The **Users** entity defines the full list of the NGB users (accounts). Note that only authorized users that were registered early can work in NGB. The user can be added or deleted from NGB users list only by another user that have the *ROLE_ADMIN* role. Users names represent the authentical domain accounts (SAML/OAuth/OpenID), e.g. e-mails. 

## Groups
The **Groups** entity defines the users grants for access to the specific datasets. Each **Group** should present a specific group of users (e.g. project team members), for which are granted or refused permissions for viewing specific datasets. The group can be created/deleted from NGB groups list or assigned to the user only by user with the *ROLE_ADMIN* role. Each NGB user can be in one or several groups or not in any of them.

## Roles
The **Roles** entity defines the users grants for managing security access to the objects. Roles are predefined by the system, none of the users can create new roles or delete existing. The role can be assigned to the user only by user with the *ROLE_ADMIN* role. Each NGB user must be assigned one or several roles.

Actual system roles list:

Role | Description

ROLE_ADMIN | Administrator. Allows to create/delete users, create/delete/assign groups, assign roles. Users with this role have the full access to the system and all types of objects
ROLE_USER | Basic user. Sets to all users by default
