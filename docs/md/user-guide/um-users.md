2. Column **Groups** - displays the groups list of the specific user. If this list is large - only first three groups are shown, other groups can be shown when hover over `...` icon. In this list there are two types of groups:
    - *domain groups* that were assigned to the user by the system environment. These groups couldn't be created, deleted, assigned or removed by the users with the *ADMIN* role. But users with the *ADMIN* role can manage permissions on these groups. Domain groups are shown in grey color:

    - *internal groups* that were created in NGB. Users with the *ADMIN* role can create/delete these groups, assign or remove users from them and manage permissions on them. Internal groups are shown in black color:
