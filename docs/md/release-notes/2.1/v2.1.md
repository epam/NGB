# Release Notes v2.1

* Tooltips over the reads and other features are now showing with a delay (1 sec)

* Added “Close” icon for all popups

* Added alignments filtering options to global “Settings”
    * Filter PCR/optical duplicates (ON by default)
    * Filter supplementary alignments (ON by default)
    * Filter failed vendor checks
    * Filter secondary alignments

* Aminoacids numbering is now implemented in two ways
    * When hovering aminoacid on a GENE track – it shows AA fullname and number
    * When enabled – AA numbers are shown on a track itself (if a zoom level allows)  
    The second option needs to be enabled (OFF by default), because it could overwhelm UI with lots of labels.  
    This setting is available under “GFF/GTF” section of “Settings” menu.  
    **_Note_**: Aminoacids are shown for a specific transcript in “Expanded” mode

* Previously existed “Projects” home page is removed
    * All registered data files are now could be arranged into hierarchies of datasets
    * Each dataset shows information on a used  reference genome and count of files in a dataset
    * Each file shows information on it’s type and a used  reference genome
    * To select a dataset or a file – checkbox should be ticked  
    **_Note_**: current implementation allows to select files only from a single dataset (you are not able to combine files from several datasets at the moment), this is an interim solution. The ability to select files from different datasets is now in development)

* VCF track now contains “Expanded/Collapsed” option
    * “Collapsed” – previously implemented/default mode. Variations are shown in a single row. If at a specific zoom level variations overlap – they are grouped into bubbles.  
    *Useful for low density VCFs*
    * “Expanded” – new implementation. If variations overlap – they are rearranged vertically.  
    *Useful for high density VCFs*

* Hotkeys are now could be used to navigate along VCF track
    * Next variation: `SHIFT`+`ARROW_RIGHT`
    * Previous variation: `SHIFT`+`ARROW_LEFT`

* “Share” button is added to a main toolbar, it allows to generate URL’s to a specific NGB view
    * Only dataset and position
    * Include tracks state (tracks heights and visualization options)
    * Layout state (include current visible/hidden panels and their sizes)
    * Hide/Show main toolbar
    * Hide/Show screenshot button
    * Hide/Show create session button

* UI state could be now stored into “Session” object
    * Selected files
    * Tracks options
    * Layout state
    * Chromosome position  
    *This feature replaces “Bookmarks” functionality, which stored only chromosome position.*

* Genes and transcripts info popups now provide annotations from:
    * Original GTF track
    * NCBI
    * Uniprot
    * Ensembl
