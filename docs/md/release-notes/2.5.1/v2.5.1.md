# Variants of translation and strand for reference track

Previously reference track could only show forward strands.

![variants_forward](images/variants_forward.png)

Now "General" hyperlink was added on reference track header. 
Feature allows to view reverse strand and all variants of sequence translations.

# Short URLs generation and handling

New functionality of generating and handling short URLs instead of long URLs was added.

New methods for UtilController were added:

* `generateShortUrl` - takes the original url and alias(optional) and generate a short postfix for storing the original url (if alias is specified but isn't unique postfix based on a hash-function will be generated`)
* `redirectToOriginalUrlByAlias` - takes a short postfix and searches for the original url, if it exists controller will redirect to the original url, otherwise will redirect to 404 error page

# Bed Graph files support

New classes for work with Bed graph files were added. `WigManager` was split in two classes for a decomposition and also `BedGraphManager` was created as a child of `AbstractWigManager`.
`FacadeWigManager` currently gets calls from `WigController` and delegates it to appropriate implementation of `AbstractWigManager`.

# Limit for lucene index size for /filter and /group API requests

For large (more than 500 Mb) VCF files Lucene index becomes too large and some requests may take too long.
Appropriate changes were done to `FeatureIndexDao` and application property `lucene.index.max.size.grouping` is added to catgenome.properties to control max index size. Default value is 4Gb.

Now when file is larger than 500 Mb:
* `/group` request doesn't return any data and 
* `/filter` request doesn't return a totalPagesCount value.

##Usability improvements

### Allele frequency thresholds settings

BAM coverage track can show colored bars with mismatches distribution at a specific locus.
![colored_bars](images/colored_bars.png)

These bars used to get colored only if a certain threshold is exceeded.
**Previously** this value was hardcoded. **Now** it can be set by changing `Allele frequency threshold` in "Settings" -> "Alignments" -> "Coverage Options".

### Vertical line through all tracks

`Show central line` option to "General" tab of "Settings" was added. It may be useful in cases when it is necessary to compare some tracks.

### Expand symbol in variation info moved to the left

Indicator was moved to the left, so it would be easier to find.
![move_expand_symbol](images/move_expand_symbol.png)

### Drop down menu sorted

Drop down menu contents sorted in alphabetical order

### Docker changes

1. `NGB core docker` is moved to `springboot jar` instead of `war` with a `tomcat`
2. `/ngs` is set a default folder for `Open from NGB` server feature. So calling `docker` run ```-v ${host_folder}:/ngs``` will allow to load files from a host machine without a registration
3. `NGB demo docker` is added, it uses core image and initializes it with demo data and a set of references
4. `buildDockerDemo` task it added to gradle
5. Documentation is updated

##Bug fixes

### Fix stuck loading indicator for bigWig/bedGraph tracks

Error occured when user is loading `.bw` file and selecting chromosome for which data in `.bw` is not represented.

Now loading indicator disappears as expected.

### Fix "Open from URL" to open more supported file types

Previously "Open from URL" menu only allowed to open VCF and BAM files as seen below.

![open_from_url](images/open_from_url_bug.png)

Now it supports formats listed below:
* BAM
* BED
* GFF/GTF
* VCF
