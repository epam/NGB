# Variants of translation and strand for reference track

Previously reference track could only show forward strand.

![variants_forward](images/variants_forward.png)

Now several options are added:
* View reverse strand
* View AA translation for forward/reverse strands

These options are available via "General" menu of a reference track

![variants_translation](images/variants_translation.png)

# Vertical line through all tracks

`Show central line` option was added for all formats. It draws a vertical line that illustrates the centre of the visualized region for each track. Previously it was only available for BAM.

# Short URLs generation and handling

Previously URLs, generated for sharing NGB views, were quite long (e.g. 1000+ letters)
In `2.5.1` URL shortener is embedded into NGB

This feature allows to:
* Generate a named URL (if alias is specified)
* Generate randomly named URL (using hash-function value)

These URLs are much shorter and easier to share

So now it looks like this:

# Bed Graph files support

NGB now supports Bed Graph files (.bdg file extension)
Registration and visualization of these files are the same as for WIG files

# Allele frequency thresholds settings

BAM coverage track can show colored bars with mismatches distribution at a specific locus
![colored_bars](images/colored_bars.png)

These bars used to get colored only if a certain threshold is exceeded
**Previously** this value was hardcoded. **Now** it can be set by changing `Allele frequency threshold` in "Settings" -> "Alignments" -> "Coverage Options"

### Drop down menu sorted

Variations Table fields selector menu is now sorted in alphabetical order

### Docker changes

1. `NGB core docker` is moved to `springboot jar` instead of `war` with a `tomcat`
2. `/ngs` is set a default folder for `Open from NGB server` feature. So calling `docker` run ```-v ${host_folder}:/ngs``` will allow to load files from a host machine without a registration
3. `NGB demo docker` is added, it uses core image and initializes it with demo data and a set of references
4. `buildDockerDemo` task it added to gradle

## Bug fixes

### Fix stuck loading indicator for bigWig/bedGraph tracks

Error occurred when user is loading `.bw` file and selecting chromosome for which data in `.bw` is not represented.

Now loading indicator disappears as expected.

### Fix "Open from URL" to open more supported file types

Previously "Open from URL" menu only allowed to open VCF and BAM files as seen below.

![open_from_url](images/open_from_url_bug.png)

Now it supports formats listed below:
* BAM
* BED
* GFF/GTF
* VCF
