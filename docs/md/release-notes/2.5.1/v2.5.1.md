# Vertical line through all tracks

`Show central line` option was added for all formats. It draws a vertical line that illustrates the centre of the visualized region for each track. Previously it was only available for BAM.

# Variants of translation and strand for reference track

Previously reference track could only show forward strands.

![variants_forward](images/variants_forward.png)

Now "General" hyperlink was added on reference track header. 
Feature allows to view reverse strand and all variants of sequence translations.

# Short URLs generation and handling

New functionality of generating and handling short URLs instead of long URLs was added.
User can optionally add alias. If alias is specified but isn't unique, postfix will be generated based on a hash-function.

So now i looks like this:

# Bed Graph files support

NGB now supports Bed Graph files (.bdg file extension).

# Limit for lucene index size for /filter and /group API requests

For large (more than 500 Mb) VCF files Lucene index becomes too large and some requests may take too long.

Now when requests `/group` or `/filter` are made, we check the size of file first, and cancel the request if it is larger than 500 Mb.

## Usability improvements

### Allele frequency thresholds settings

BAM coverage track can show colored bars with mismatches distribution at a specific locus.
![colored_bars](images/colored_bars.png)

These bars used to get colored only if a certain threshold is exceeded.
**Previously** this value was hardcoded. **Now** it can be set by changing `Allele frequency threshold` in "Settings" -> "Alignments" -> "Coverage Options".

### Expand symbol in variation info moved to the left

Indicator was moved to the left, so it would be easier to find.
![move_expand_symbol](images/move_expand_symbol.png)

### Drop down menu sorted

Drop down menu contents sorted in alphabetical order.

### Docker changes

1. `NGB core docker` is moved to `springboot jar` instead of `war` with a `tomcat`
2. `/ngs` is set a default folder for `Open from NGB server` feature. So calling `docker` run ```-v ${host_folder}:/ngs``` will allow to load files from a host machine without a registration.
3. `NGB demo docker` is added, it uses core image and initializes it with demo data and a set of references.
4. `buildDockerDemo` task it added to gradle.
5. Documentation is updated.

## Bug fixes

### Fix stuck loading indicator for bigWig/bedGraph tracks

Error occurred when user is loading `.bw` file and selecting chromosome for which data in `.bw` is not represented.

Now loading indicator disappears as expected.

### Fix "Open from URL" to open more supported file types

Previously "Open from URL" menu only allowed to open VCF and BAM files as seen below.

![open_from_url](images/open_from_url_bug.png)

Now it supports formats listed below:
* BAM
* BED
* GFF/GTF
* VCF
