# Highlight variations depending on the selected profile with complex conditions

Test verifies
 - Background colour of Variations in the Variants panel and VCF track is highlighted according to the selected profile with complex conditions

**Prerequisites**:

1. dataset = **dm6_data**, .vcf = **[agnts3.09-28.trim.dm606.realign.vcf](https://ngb-oss-builds.s3.amazonaws.com/public/data/demo/ngb_demo_data/agnts3.09-28.trim.dm606.realign.vcf.gz)**
2. **interest_profiles.json** that contains **'Complex Conditions'** profile with conditions
```
 "Complex Conditions" : {
        "is_default" : true,
        "conditions" : [
            {
                "highlight_color" : "0083ff",
                "condition" : "(ReadPosRankSum > 1) and (ReadPosRankSum < 3) and (DP <= 200)"
            },
            {
                "highlight_color" : "149150",
                "condition" : "(DP in [386, 435]) and (SOR == 1.461)"
            },
            {
                "highlight_color" : "ce632d",
                "condition" : "(DP in [386, 435]) and ((SOR == 1.461) or (SOR == 1.227))"
            },
            {
                "highlight_color" : "f92900",
                "condition" : "(DP notin [597,587]) and (DP >= 543) and (MQ != 91.95)"
            },
              {
                "highlight_color" : "ff00b2",
                "condition" : "(FS > 412) or (QD > 36)"
            }
           ]

| 10 | Click on variation with Position **chr X:12584271** |Browser window is opened with vcf track |
| 11 | At the vcf-track, select **'Collapsed'** view (if it was not set previously)| |
| 12 | Look at variation on vcf track in Browser| Variation is highlighted in color  **'0083ff'(blue)** along all its length in **collapsed** view |
| 13 | At the vcf-track, select **'Expanded'** view | |
| 14 | Look at variation on vcf track in Browser| Variation is highlighted in color  **'0083ff'(blue)** along all its length in **expanded** view |
| 15 | Repeat steps 8-14 for every variation's position shown in the table below | |
