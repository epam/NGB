# Highlight structural variations depending on the selected profile 

Test verifies
 - Background colour of Structural Variations in the Variants panel and VCF track is highlighted according to the selected profile

**Prerequisites**:

1. dataset = **SV_Sample1**, .vcf = **[sample_1-lumpy.vcf](https://ngb-oss-builds.s3.amazonaws.com/public/data/demo/ngb_demo_data/sample_1-lumpy.vcf.gz)**
2. dataset = **SV_Sample2**, .vcf = **[sample_2-lumpy.vcf](https://ngb-oss-builds.s3.amazonaws.com/public/data/demo/ngb_demo_data/sample_2-lumpy.vcf.gz)**
3. **interest_profiles.json** that contains **'Structural variations'** profile with conditions
```

| 6 | Go to **Datasets** tab | |
| 7 | Select datasets and vcf files from **Prerequisites** | Vcf files are selected in datasets | 
| 8 | Go to **Variants** panel | |
| 9 | Find Variation on Position **Chr 5: 181050143** | Background of variation highlight in **'ff0000'(red)** color |
| 10 | Click on variation with Position **Chr 5: 181050143** | Browser window is opened with vcf track |
| 11 | At the vcf-track, select **'Collapsed'** view (if it was not set previously)| |
| 12 | Look at variation on vcf track in Browser | Variation and it's label is highlighted in color  **'ff0000'(red)** along all its length in **collapsed** view |
| 13 | At the vcf-track, select **'Expanded'** view | 
| 14 | Look at variation on vcf track in Browser | Variation and it's label is highlighted in color  **'ff0000'(red)** along all its length in **expanded** view |
| 15 | Repeat steps 8-14 for every variation's position shown in the table below | |
