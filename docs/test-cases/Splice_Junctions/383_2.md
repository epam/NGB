# Check Splice Junctions filtering

Test verified ...

 **Prerequisites**:

 - Dataset1
 - BAM track (***brain_th.bam***) that contains splice junctions tracks in Dataset1.
 - Global Settings >> **Alignments** tab >> **Splice Junctions** section >> **Enable filtering** checkbox is unshecked.

| Steps | Actions | Expected results |
| :---: | --- | --- |
| 1 | Login to NGB | |
| 2 | Go to Dateset panel. Expand Dataset1 using an arrow icon next to a group name. | |
| 3 | Tick track1.bam in the Dataset1 list to toggle its visibility. | |
| 4 | Select needed chromosome from the chromosome selector dropdown (zoom in track if needed). | Splice Junctions track isn't shown by default|
| 5 | Open **General** menu in BAM track's header. | |
| 6 | Check **Show splice junctions** option. | Splice junctions represented by an arcs are shown for the track: <li> Junctions from the positive strand extend above the center line. <li> Junctions from the negative strand extend below the center line. <li> Junctions with positive and negative strands have different colours according to the settings. <li> The height of the arc, and its thickness, are proportional to the depth.|
| 7 | Hover over the splice junctions arcs and look at the depth value for junctions. | |
| 8 | Open Global Settings. | |
| 9 | Go to **Alignments** tab. | |
| 10 | Navigate to **Splice Junctions** section. | |
| 11 | Check **Enable filtering** checkbox. | |
| 12 | Enter average value from step 7 into the minimum coverage threshold value field. Click **Save** button. | <li> Only splice junctions with depth less than threshold aren't shown. <li> Configured threshold is displayed at BAM track header as label  `Splice junctions minimum coverage: <value>`. |
| 13 | Repeat steps 8-10. | |
| 14 | Uncheck **Enable filtering** checkbox. Click **Save** button. | <li> All splice junctions are shown <li> Label `Splice junctions minimum coverage: <value>` isn't shown. |
