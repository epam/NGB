     * Determines authorization. The order of the <code>permission</code> and
     * <code>sid</code> arguments is <em>extremely important</em>! The method will iterate
     * through each of the <code>permission</code>s in the order specified. For each
     * iteration, all of the <code>sid</code>s will be considered, again in the order they
     * are presented. A search will then be performed for the first
     * {@link AccessControlEntry} object that directly matches that
     * <code>permission:sid</code> combination. When the <em>first full match</em> is
     * found (ie an ACE that has the SID currently being searched for and the exact
     * permission bit mask being search for), the grant or deny flag for that ACE will
     * prevail. If the ACE specifies to grant access, the method will return
     * <code>true</code>. If the ACE specifies to deny access, the loop will stop and the
     * next <code>permission</code> iteration will be performed. If each permission
     * indicates to deny access, the first deny ACE found will be considered the reason
     * for the failure (as it was the first match found, and is therefore the one most
     * logically requiring changes - although not always). If absolutely no matching ACE
     * was found at all for any permission, the parent ACL will be tried (provided that
     * there is a parent and {@link Acl#isEntriesInheriting()} is <code>true</code>. The
     * parent ACL will also scan its parent and so on. If ultimately no matching ACE is
     * found, a <code>NotFoundException</code> will be thrown and the caller will need to
     * decide how to handle the permission check. Similarly, if any of the SID arguments
     * presented to the method were not loaded by the ACL,
     * <code>UnloadedSidException</code> will be thrown.
     *
     * @param permission         the exact permissions to scan for (order is important)
     * @param sids               the exact SIDs to scan for (order is important)
     * @param administrativeMode if <code>true</code> denotes the query is for
     *                           administrative purposes and no auditing will be undertaken
     * @return <code>true</code> if one of the permissions has been granted,
     * <code>false</code> if one of the permissions has been specifically revoked
     * @throws NotFoundException if an exact ACE for one of the permission bit masks and
